Note about RecordMyStats.PostgresDatabase project
---------------------------------------------------

So note that there is no "postgres database project" in visual studio (that I know about - send me an email if you know of one) which 
can be used to publish a database, similar to the visual studio database project which works with sql server and compatible 
(e.g. local db) databases. That normal db project <em>can</em> be published to create a new database.  

This project here is not that kind of db project.

This project is simply a storage container type project (technically using a Class Library project type) which is now being used 
to store the database scripts for postgres.

You can use these script files in this project to create new database and tables for postgres.  

Currently you would need to run these scripts in a postgres database management tool like pgAdmin or psql.
